#Model Description

This code builds up to an agent based model (ABM). ABMs are generally iterative models. They run by allowing the agents repeat the activities they are programmed to do for a certain number of iterations.

In this model, we created 10 entities that randomly move around a 100x100 plane. These entities eat data off the environment, share their data with other entities in their neighbourhood and finally, eject data back into the environment in the case they have been too greedy.

The code is then animated to show the movements of the agents and their activities interacting with the environment.
